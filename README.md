EdFlix's backend program: Spring Boot
FFmpeg is used to convert streams into .m3u8 files
All files uploaded to Azure
Serving videos using HLS protocol, Adaptive Bitrate.

I initially prototyped EdFlix in both C# and Java, but continued full development in Java because the RASMP-inspired SSA module was fully implemented in Java and tightly integrated with the backend. I am now re-writing this module in C# and plan to switch to C# after rigorous testing and validation.
